            <h3>Introduce yourself using the Alfred FYI command.</h3>
            <pre><code>alfred fyi</code></pre>
            <p><i>Alfred uses your introduction to remember who you are, including your gender and more, allowing for
                    tailored interactions that suit your preferences.</i></p>
            <p>Example: alfred fyi I'm Jimmy, a 19 year old male swedish student. I study agriculture at harvard. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Set your timezone with the Alfred timezone command.</h3>
            <pre><code>alfred timezone</code></pre>
            <p><i>This will ensure alfred takes your local time into account when talking to you, allowing for more
                    accurate and specific responses to queries.</i></p>

            <h2>How to Talk to Alfred</h2>
            <h3>Start a conversation</h3>
            <p>You can start a conversation by saying "Hey Alfred", this is just one of many ways to initiate a
                conversation. You can also immediately append your query after "Hey Alfred".<br>Example: "Hey alfred,
                how are you?"</p>

            <h3>End a conversation</h3>
            <p>You can end a conversation by saying "That's all" / "That is all". This is, again, just one of many ways
                to end a conversation.

                <p>Alfred doesn't store past conversations, although I have considered adding persistent memory in the
                    future, allowing Alfred to remember specific things that has happened in past conversations.</p>
